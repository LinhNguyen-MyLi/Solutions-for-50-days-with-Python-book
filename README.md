# Solutions-for-50-days-with-Python-book
The ultimate goal for this repo is to train my skill with Python each day by solving at least challenge in the book.  My solution might be different from solution of the book but still generate the same result so I think I'm still right in some extent. But if you, by any chance, see my mistake please inform me, it's a great opportunity for me to learn from you.
